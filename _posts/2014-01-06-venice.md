From October to December 2011, I was in the beautiful city of Venice, Italy, working on my Interactive Qualifying Project. There were 32 of us from WPI undertaking various projects ranging from creating interactive art installations to [measuring noise levels around the city](http://venicenoise.org).

My group&#8217;s task was to document the methods used to maintain Venice&#8217;s aging infrastructure. Every week, we spent hours in meetings, then would go back to our &#8220;war room&#8221; to write descriptive articles. The reason for this was that Insula, the agency responsible for the city&#8217;s upkeep, was being shut down due to lack of funding. Sure enough, during our final week in Italy, the headlines came out announcing Insula&#8217;s closure.

We decided to split the work so that I would create all the graphics, and the other three members of the group would write all the articles. This turned out to be a pretty fair division of labor overall; however, the diagrams in particular had to go through many revisions such that every single part of them was accurate. I remember adding a brick texture to one of the bridge diagrams, only to be admonished for using the wrong pattern of bricklaying and unrealistic brick dimensions. These details *had* to be correct, though, because once Insula closed its doors, our project would be the only existing documentation of these methods.

Another part of the project involved creating MediaWiki pages about every bridge, canal, and street in the entire city. We had all the information sitting in a database, and it seemed like it would be a massive manual undertaking to write up all these articles. However, I decided it would be quicker to write a program that would automatically generate these pages.

To this end, I wrote software that I called [QwikiWiki](https://code.google.com/p/qwiki-wiki/). This consisted of a PHP endpoint that handled the database, as well as a Java application that combined the templates with the database. (This was one of my first forays into web development, so I wasn&#8217;t yet comfortable enough to write the whole thing in HTML/PHP/JavaScript.)

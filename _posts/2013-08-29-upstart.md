At work I've been tasked with converting a cronjob to run on Ubuntu's excellent 
[Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/) system. I have to say, Upstart is
freaking awesome for someone who's worked with [Node's](http://nodejs.org) event
system or anything in Java that has Listener as part of the name.

## Creating a job

Creating a job is as simple as placing a configuration file in `/etc/init`.

#### sample1.conf

    start on startup    
     
    script
      /path/to/important/script.sh
    end script

## Linking jobs together

Instead of making your workflow into one massive job, split it into separate
files and make them listen for each other. For example, suppose you want to
prepare some data from a database (convert it, perhaps) and then upload it to
a server:

#### prepare-data.conf
    
    task
    script
        /script/to/prepare/data.sh
        initctl emit data-prepared
    end script
    
#### upload-data.conf

    start on data-prepared
    task
    script
        /script/to/upload/data.sh
    end script
    
    
This way, you can fire off a series of events and not have to worry.

Our configuration requires that one server be able to touch off events on another.
To do this, we're using "signal files" so one server SSHes in and `touch`es
the signal file on the other. Upstart makes this easy too:

#### on-server-1.conf

    task
    script
        my-action.sh
        ssh server-2 "touch /path/to/notify/job-1-done"
    end script
    
#### on-server-2.conf

    start on file FILE=/path/to/notify/job-1-done
    task
    script
        my-action-2.sh
    end script

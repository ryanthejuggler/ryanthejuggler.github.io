My customized [Rostock] 3D printer is moving! After over a year of working on it in between graduating college and other projects, I've finally got it moving. It's currently running a partially-configured fork of [Marlin]. When I say *partially* configured I mean **very slightly** configured--the print head thinks it's on the print bed when in reality it's still got a good 7 inches to go. I wrote a quick [test generator] using [Node.js] and ran it; there's [a video] of it on YouTube if you're interested.

I've got a long way to go before my first print, but I'm super-happy with my progress so far! Hopefully soon I'll have it in a good place to use it as a plotter.

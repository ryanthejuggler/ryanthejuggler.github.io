Whenever I picture a painter, I always imagine a man in a dirty smock and paint-stained beard, scrutinizing an easel in a sparse studio apartment in a European city. He stands in front of his half-finished work, which is facing the open window slightly to catch the sunlight. He has no deadlines, no supervisor, and no pressure, but the work he produces is entirely without parallel.

Sure, this guy is totally fictional. But he embodies the idea of the “creative person”—no set schedule, no limits. If inspiration strikes him at 3 a.m. then he can immediately set to work. If it’s 4 in the afternoon and he’s hit a block, he can go fix himself a snack and go for a walk rather than waste time waiting for 5 to roll around. You wouldn’t give a painter his oils and canvas at 9 a.m. and then take them away at 5 expecting a masterpiece.

A programmer is also a creative professional. Yes, there’s a certain amount of logic involved, and yes, the results of his* work are considerably more constrained than those of the artist’s, but being an exceptional programmer—anything involving complexity and novelty—requires an ability to think laterally and willingness to color outside the lines.

The difference between the programmer and the painter, though, is that programming shapes our modern world. Most businesses employing over 50 people need custom asset management systems, payment systems, interactive websites… the point being that programmers are very much in demand. This introduces an interesting problem—you’re taking a creative professional and forcing him to conform to 9-to-5 life in order to be able to push deadlines. The coder is valuable because he is able to think outside the box and create these solutions, yet shoehorning him into a traditional workday reduces his effectiveness. This leads to disappointment on the part of both management and the managed.

Some companies recognize this and reward their employees with the opportunity to truly work at their full potential—a simple reward, yet one that’s extremely difficult for most companies to offer. The 2010 movie _The Social Network_ portrayed very well the idea of being “wired in,” or so attuned to your work that the outside world seems irrelevant. The one thing I’d add to that portrayal is the fact that you can’t just “wire in” any time you like; it’s something that develops naturally during a really good coding session. Real-world companies recognize that this is a real thing; for instance, [GitHub has very flexible hours](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/) in order to allow its employees to truly jam on their platform, instead of trudging through 8-hour workdays obligatorily. The GitHub workday is “asynchronous,” meaning that coders ping each other as needed via instant message instead of participating in mandatory meetings that knock them out of the zone, [a very real place](http://www.independentdeveloper.com/archive/2009/03/17/programming-is-like-a-dream) where the best work gets done.

I think that ultimately in the future, the GitHub model will prevail, simply because the quality of the code that gets created during a “jam” is far superior to code created in “the standard Dilbert veal-fattening farm,” [as Joel Spolsky puts it](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html). More effective programmers leads to more innovative, adaptable businesses, which by simple Darwinism should mean that traditional business hours in the tech industry will seem as out-of-date as top hats and (un-ironic) handlebar moustaches.

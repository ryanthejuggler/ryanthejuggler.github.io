I've been frustrated for some time at how *old* shell behavior is. Don't get me wrong; I love `zsh` for its
autocomplete, its useful prompts, and a whole slew of other reasons. However, `zsh` and `bash` are still, for all
intents and purposes, stuck in the days of the text-only terminal. I use [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)
at work, which is pretty slick; however, at the end of the day it's still just a method for getting keystrokes into a
shell prompt and nothing more.

To remedy this, I have a proposal for a new type of terminal that will allow admins to be much more productive, without
having to rewrite a large part of UNIX.

## Let's pretend it's 2013 and not 1983

`mosh`, the **mo**dern **sh**ell, allows you to graphically see what you're doing, and actually use modern advances in
technology such as, for instance, the mouse.

Basically, you can edit your command in the bottom area and use Ctrl+Enter to run it. The top screen is a normal
terminal as you find nowadays. That way, if your program requires command-line interaction, you'll still be able to
enter keystrokes without having to rewrite your whole operating system. You could, of course, simply use bash or zsh
in this top window, and probably get away with it. However, the bottom window has syntax highlighting and a cursor you
can click to set. No more furiously stabbing the arrow keys!

Another feature is the ability to view pipe flows:

Here, each time a command is piped to another command, it's represented by an arrow. This shows the flow of information
quite easily, and you can restart the flow at any point by clicking the appropriate "run" button. This is useful if you
have a long-running process that needs to pipe its output to another process, and you want to be able to test without
triggering the long-running process again. If you click `run` in the middle of a chain, it will simply reuse the input
from the last time the previous command was run.

This also would be useful for testing different flows; for instance, if you have a test API and a production API, you
could use the same workflow for each but just drag the tip of the arrow from one node to another to represent this
change.

I don't know if I'll build this, but I'm certainly hooked on the idea that something like this would really make development
a lot easier!

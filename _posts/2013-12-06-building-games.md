When I was in high school, I spent a lot of my time building games in Java. I hung out on the [Java Gaming](http://www.java-gaming.org/)
forums a lot, and built more than my fair share of pointless little games. From what I can remember, I built:

 * A PacMan clone with Super Mario sprites ([Piranha Plant](https://www.google.com/search?q=piranha+plant&espv=2&es_sm=91&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=3ymiUq-7D6zhsAT434LgDQ&ved=0CDwQsAQ&biw=1440&bih=828)
 as PacMan!)
 * A game called FallDown ([JAR file](/assets/FallDown.jar)) that I made for the [2007 Java4K](http://www.javaunlimited.net/games/java4k_2007.php) contest
 * A simple 3D racing game using Java3D
 * A sliding-block puzzle that used photos found on your hard drive
 * A "toy" that would render a webcam image of you like the old [iPod ads](https://lh3.ggpht.com/-MwwQqBSIzXs/TnTStod1XZI/AAAAAAAAALM/-vXkdMdQzqw/s1600/ipod-green.jpg)
 * An "Asteroids" clone

You get the idea... I liked making little games and other pointless stuff. Unfortunately, my parents' computer on which
I was building all this stuff died, leaving me only with the compiled form of FallDown (since it was already on the Internet).
I wish I had all this old stuff because I'm sure it would be a treasure trove of terrible coding habits!

These little projects gave me the skills I needed to be useful as a professional coder. If not for FallDown, for instance,
I might never have learned how to optimize for space; if not for the racing game, I'd have been clueless when working on
my undergraduate thesis on how to approach 3D programming; and if not for the iPod ad toy, I'd have had no exposure to
basic image processing. Every little project I pursued taught me something, and that's why I pursued them. Not because
the projects themselves had intrinsic value, but because I was becoming a better coder by working on them.

At some point I decided that I should stop making games and focus instead on more productive pursuits. I started to become
obsessed with thinking of what products I could create in my spare time that would bring in cash. (Of course, being in
college, I didn't have a lot of cash, and therefore this was a pretty powerful motivation.) I started putting enormous
pressure on myself to create something profitable. Yet, despite about 2 years of placing this pressure on myself,
I never launched a single product. I have very little publicly available projects, measured by [GitHub](http://github.com/ryanthejuggler)
or otherwise (app stores, etc.).

The thing about making games was that there was really no goal to it. I could sit at my computer with a fresh idea,
crank something out, and refine it until I felt happy with it. Trying to create the perfect to-do list app, on the other
hand, made me constantly redefine where my endpoint was. I kept pushing off adding new features because I was trying to
get the existing ones "perfect".

I may not start building games right away, but I think that I'm at least going to try to take a break from putting this
enormous pressure on myself to create a profitable project. I miss the *fun* stages of learning to program, and although
I've got a pretty good handle on coding right now, I think I can get back to where I was while I was learning. I think
I can find [a whole new world where programming is fun again](http://xkcd.com/353/).

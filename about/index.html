<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Fully Reversed Engineering <small class="extra">2012-2013</small></h3>
<p> Developed a low-cost, high-resolution 3D scanner. Researched existing methods for obtaining scan information. Worked as part of a team to derive equations needed for the application. Created a new method of 3D scanning to allow our system to be constructed at low cost. Implemented calculation and user interface software using C++, OpenCV, and Qt. <a href="https://github.com/ryanthejuggler/fully-reversed">Wrote paper</a> and created poster to communicate methods and findings.</p>

<h3>Scout Transatlantic <small class="extra">2012-2013</small></h3>
<p> Designed and wrote communications software for an autonomous robotic boat that ended up (unofficially) breaking the world record for unaided robotic boat navigation. Created <a href="https://github.com/ryanthejuggler/Iridium9612">an Arduino library</a> for interfacing with an Iridium satellite transmitter. Wrote a Python cron task to handle incoming satellite transmissions on a web server and push them to a MySQL database. Built <a href="http://gotransat.com/tracking/">an interactive PHP/HTML/JavaScript frontend</a> based on a team member's visual design.</p>

<h3>Building Blocks of Venice <small class="extra">2011</small></h3>
<p>Researched and documented maintenance techniques for elements of Venice's infrastructure. Participated in professional sponsor meetings. Created over 40 illustrations. Developed a Java application along with PHP API to easily convert database entries into MediaWiki pages.

<h3>ITAR Search Utility <small class="extra">2010</small></h3>
<p>Conceived and developed software to search online government databases for parties whose actions are restricted by the government. Designed and created search capabilities from scratch and user interface, both using Java in the Eclipse programming environment.
